# SQL JOINs Practice Project

This project includes table creation, sample data, and JOIN queries to practise SQL join logic using MySQL.

## Tables

- `salesman`
- `customer`
- `orders`

## Topics Covered

- `INNER JOIN`
- `LEFT JOIN`
- Join conditions with foreign keys
- Filtering with `BETWEEN`, `IS NULL`, `GROUP BY`, and more

## Folder Structure

- `schema.sql`: Table creation scripts
- `data.sql`: Insert statements for populating tables
- `queries/`: JOIN practice exercises, separated by JOIN type

## Requirements

- MySQL or any SQL tool that supports standard ANSI SQL
- Note: Some SQL environments (like MySQL Workbench) may treat `name` as a reserved keyword. While this project omits backticks (`) for clarity, feel free to wrap `name` in backticks (e.g., \`name\`) if your environment requires it.

## How to Use

1. Run `schema.sql` to create the tables.
2. Run `data.sql` to populate them.
3. Explore the queries in the `queries/` folder to practise JOINs.
